			Rising Rice Prices? A Longitudinal Study into the Interplay of Agricultural Goods Prices and
			Seasons
		</h1>
		<p class="text-xl">
			Despite being an agricultural country, there is a <strong>lack</strong> of research regarding
			price changes for agricultural products. In recent years, prices of goods have been

			that affect it. Hence, we used data science to gain insight into the trends and patterns of
			agricultural prices and subsequently learn the significant factors that affect prices of
			agricultural goods.
