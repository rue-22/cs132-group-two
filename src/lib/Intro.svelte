			Rising Rice Prices? A Longitudinal Study into the Interplay of Agricultural Goods Prices and
			Seasons
		</h1>
		<p class="text-xl">
			To combat the rise of prices in rice, among other commodities, the Philippine Government
			issued the Rice Tariffication Law in 2019, which eases import restrictions of rice. Despite
			this, the Filipino people have not experienced relief from rising prices of goods. Thus, there
			have been movements in the government to review this law. However, a review of related
			literature suggests that existing studies that analyze price movement of agricultural
			commodities are lacking in either coverage or recency.
